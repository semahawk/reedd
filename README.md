# Cara

## Synopsis

Cara is a simple package manager for Caroline Linux.

__NOTE:__ Cara (and Caroline Linux) are in highly starting stage, it shouldn't be considered stable and usable. Till sometime.

## Installing

To install Cara do the standard:

    make

followed by:

    sudo make install

__NOTE:__ The default install directory is `/usr/local/bin/` (yup, it's a single binary file right now :D). It could be overwritten by running:

    make BINDIR=<path> install

## Uninstalling

Installing is even easier:

    sudo make uninstall
